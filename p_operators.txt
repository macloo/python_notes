Operators - LPTHW ex. 37
------------------------

+	add
-	subtract
*	multiply
**	exponent, e.g. 10**20 is 10 to the 20th power
/	divide
//	deletes numbers after decimal, e.g. 9.0 // 2.0 = 4.0 whereas 
    9.0 / 2.0 = 4.5
%	modulus; get remainder from division
<	less than
>	greater than
<=	less than or equal to
>=	greater than or equal to
==	equivalence, e.g. if x == 10: 
!=	not equal to, e.g. if x != 10:
<>	seems to be same as != 
( )	parens, for math, for tuples
[ ]	square brackets, for lists
{ }	curly braces, for dictionaries
@	at sign - used in "decorators":
	https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary
,	comma; use between things in a list
:	colon; use at end of lines starting with def, if, while, etc.
.	decimal point
=	equals; use to assign a value
;	semicolon (for what?)
+=	increment
-=	decrement
*=	c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a
/=	c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a
//=	probably same as above, below
%=	c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a
**=	c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
