Python Notes (Python 2.7)
=========================

In trying to learn Python, I have used several resources. I have produced a lot of files, some of which I probably will never need again.

In this repo, I am saving my files to which I expect to return, for reference.

The tests/ directory contains trivial small files, referenced in some of my notes.

## The Files

* alien_while_loop.py

  Use of random number to make a simple fight scene; if-elif-else; while-loop

* builtin_functions.py

  10 useful built-in functions, used in examples.

* format_strings.py

  Demo of how using a different formatter produces different output.

* lists_practice.py

  Things we can do with lists.

* modulo_test.py

  Demo showing how modulo (modulus) works: Test a number to see if it is prime.

* p_data_types.txt
* p_escapes.txt
* p_keywords.txt
* p_operators.txt
* p_string_formatters.txt

  My notes about these, following LPTHW ex. 37.

* p_style_guide.txt

  My notes about Python style (from PEP 8).

* print_python_keywords.py

  Short program that prints all Python keywords.

* turtle_tests.py

  Learning to use Python's turtle module.
