Python Notes (Python 2.7)
=========================

In trying to learn Python, I have used several resources. I have produced a lot of files, some of which I probably will never need again.

In this repo, I am saving my files to which I expect to return, for reference.

The tests/ directory contains trivial small files, referenced in some of my notes.

## The Files

* alien_while_loop.py

  Use of random number to make a simple fight scene; if-elif-else; while-loop

* builtin_functions.py

  10 useful built-in functions, used in examples.

* format_strings.py

  Demo of how using a different formatter produces different output.

* lists_practice.py

  Things we can do with lists.

* modulo_test.py

  Demo showing how modulo (modulus) works: Test a number to see if it is prime.

* print_python_keywords.py

  Short program that prints all Python keywords.

* string_searches.py

  Run various tests on a string to find out whether it would be okay 
  to use it as a filename.

* turtle_tests.py

  Learning to use Python's turtle module.

* useful_modules.py

  Tests with copy, random, time, pickle (for saving binary data out, as from a game, and then reading it back in).

* write_read_file.py

  Writing non-text data into a file as text and (awesomely) reconstituting 
  the data back into Python objects as you read it out of the text file.

## Files in /tests

Very trivial small files to show me how something is done.

## Files in /texts

* p_data_types.txt 
* p_escapes.txt 
* p_keywords.txt 
* p_operators.txt 
* p_string_formatters.txt 
  
  
  My notes about these, following LPTHW ex. 37.

* p_style_guide.txt
  
  
  My notes about Python style (from PEP 8).
